### Which ML technique(s) and library packages (built using which languages) are popular? 
In the paper I read, most authors utilized Python, some of them used R. The academic literature search showed that various ML algorithms are used by previous researchers. Random Forest, SVM, KNN,CNN, DNN, PCA are commonly used.

### Which software packages (and which libraries within the package) are used for which tasks? 
There are three library packages are very popular: pandas (for data loading and pre-processing), scikit-learn (for both pre-processing and the models implementations) and matplotlib (for visualization purposes). ML algorithms used in detecting and diagnosing Covid-19 primarily rely on classification algorithms, including Random Forest, SVM and Neural Network.
